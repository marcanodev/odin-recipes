    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sancocho is an extremely popular stew in Latin American countries like the
      Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and more. Our favorite
      implementation of this recipe is that of the Dominican Republic. This
      amazing stew has over 25 ingredients and a life-changing effect on your
      taste buds. Recently there was a Sancocho Festival held in the Dominican
      Republic where several chefs competed in a showdown of flavor. The grand
      prize was awarded to the chef that had the best tasting sancocho. While we
      may not be expert chefs, we can definitely make ourselves some sancocho
      that is sure to make us standout amongst the casual cooks of the world.
      Let's get started!

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mash oregano, garlic, and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl until well combined.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Mix beef, pork, chicken, and lemon juice together in a large bowl; drain
        1/2 of the liquid. Mix in onions, mashed garlic mixture, 2 tablespoons
        oil, and vinegar.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
        meat mixture in three batches and cook until browned on all sides, 10 to
        15 minutes per batch.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Transfer browned meats to an 8-quart Dutch oven. Pour in 1/2 of the
        water, then add chicken broth, beef consommé, 2 bouillon cubes, and
        remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low,
        cover, and simmer until meats are more than halfway cooked through,
        about 40 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Add pumpkin, sweet potatoes, eddeos, yuca, potatoes, plantains, corn,
        celery, carrots, bell pepper, cilantro, remaining bouillon cubes, and
        adobo seasoning to the Dutch oven. Increase the heat to medium and
        return to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring in
        remaining water as needed in gradual increments to replace evaporated
        liquid, until root vegetables are soft and liquid has thickened, 1 to 2
        hours.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        During the last 30 minutes of cooking, transfer beef, pork, and chicken
        to a cutting board. Let cool slightly, then remove bones and chop or
        shred meat. Return meat to the stew and finish cooking.
      </li>
