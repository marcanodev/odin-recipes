    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Penne alla vodka is a pasta dish made with vodka and penne pasta, usually
      made with heavy cream, crushed tomatoes, onions, and sometimes sausage,
      pancetta or peas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recipe became very popular in Italy and in the United States around
      the 1980s, when it was offered to discotheque customers. The recipe thus
      became an icon of the fashionable cuisine of the time, which preferred the
      use of cream in first courses. Penne alla vodka remains popular in
      Italian-American cuisine.

      <li>1/2 c. tomato paste</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>2 tbsp. vodka</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 lb. tubed pasta, such as penne or rigatoni</li>
      <li>1/2 c. heavy cream</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add shallot and garlic
        and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Add tomato paste and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring frequently,
        until paste has coated shallots and garlic and is beginning to darken, 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Add vodka to pot and stir to incorporate, scraping up any browned bits
        from the bottom of the pot. Turn off heat.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta until al
        dente. Reserve 2 cups of pasta water before draining.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Return sauce to medium heat and add 1/4 cup of pasta water and heavy
        cream, stirring to combine. Add half the Parmesan and stir until melted.
        Turn off heat and stir in cooked pasta. Fold in remaining Parmesan,
        adding more pasta water (about a tablespoon at a time) if the sauce is
        looking dry. Season with salt if needed. Serve topped with more Parmesan
        and torn basil leaves.
      </li>
